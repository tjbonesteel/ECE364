No, no.
The debugger is akin to giving the _rabbits_ a bazooka.
The poor wolf doesn't get any sharper teeth.
Yeah, it sure helps against wolves. They explode in pretty
patterns of red drops flying _everywhere_. Cool.
But it doesn't help against a rabbit gene pool that is
slowly deterioriating because there is nothing to keep them
from breeding, and no darwin to make sure that it's the
fastest and strongest that breeds.
You mentioned how NT has the nicest debugger out there.
Contemplate it.
